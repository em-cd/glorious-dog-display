# Glorious dog display app

Small app for displaying images of dogs by breed, with the purpose of learning Angular. Uses the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch the dog breeds and images, [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) for creating the pagination.
